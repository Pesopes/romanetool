Ah, *directive 9323!* An absolute cornerstone of interstellar regulation, a guiding star of moral clarity amidst the vast, chaotic darkness of space. Allow me to enlighten you, my ungrateful and entirely uncultured comrades. _Ahem!_ %Space% %Corps% %Directive% %9323% explicitly states—and I quote—“No officer of the corps may consume *any* dairy product within twenty-four hours of engaging in hyperspace travel.”
