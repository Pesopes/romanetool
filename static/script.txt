# NOTES:
# Shamelessly stolen from celeste
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# %wavy text%
# *impact text*
# \n creates a newline, without a page break
